# Assorted Python Scripts


This repository contains assorted Python scripts I have made as I've been (still am) learning Python. Includes a variety of topics, ranging from the use specific of libraries and modules and Python development (e.g. classes), to puzzles and challenges I've found around.

Please contact me if there is a bug or mistake!
